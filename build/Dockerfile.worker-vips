# Phase 2/3 target image:
# 1) Build libvips + libheif with required codecs.
# 2) Build worker with CGO enabled + govips bindings.
# 3) Copy worker binary and runtime shared libraries into slim image.
#
# This file is intentionally a scaffold so the team can fill exact dependency
# pins and build flags once the govips pipeline is implemented.
